The Rock Paper Scissors Project
In this application, users play rock paper scissors with a simple AI player.
For each round, the user picks either rock, paper, or scissors, and the AI randomly picks one of its three.
Each round has a winner and the winner's score is recorded. This game does not end.

This is my take on the second project assignment found on the Odin Project's Foundation course.

This application is made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
This application uses Javascript to "change" pages (its contents) instead of using <a> tag 
to link to different HTML files.
